My Minsweeper adaptation for the Ti-83 will be text based, and will play on a 7x16 grid. The top line will be reserved for score?
(The top line will be reserved for something)

Basic Components:
-Image for splashscreen ('cuz why the fuck not?) EDIT: no .83i - too advanced - Replace with output finction text
-Bomb position randomizer (pre determone bomb locations and store in variables)
-Cursor component (Use arrow keys to move a charachtor to represent the cursor. Will be displayed with output function and variables.)
-Bomb counter for opened spaces (use variables and math to determine)
-Game loss animation (replace all bombs uncovered+not with a new charahter to represent exploded bomb)
-Bomb flagging system (replace blank square with charachter to represnt flag when user selects it for bomb
-Game loss screen (either .83i or use of output function) EDIT: no .83i - too advanced

Bomb (Exploding)- Asterisk*
Flag- Exclamtion!
Uncharted- 0
Cursor- X




Thoughts:
Plan for bomb position determination- 2 Lists of random numbers in a certain range. use nested loop with random number functions to determine coordinates.
Cursor spawn + movement - Maybie use a getkey loop for (arrow keys) inside a getkey loop for (enter) // to enable movement until a position/tile is selected.
ERR:DOMAIN on cursor print - Speculated Reson -> Value not set beforehand, tried to print at {0,0}. Set value of [V,B] before tracking loop.
Cursor movement is now functional; SILL LEFT TO CORRECT:
-BOUNDARY ----->Change the if movement statemnets to require 2 conitions 1.The Key value(no problem) 2.The value higher/lower than [V/B] will not make it go out of bounds. (Logic and values will differ on each axis/ if statement)
-GOING OVER TILES OTHER THAN "0"S ----->Theory - Not enough variables, so create 3 new lists, one for X value, one for Y value, and one for key value. Reference this information when replacing a tile when the cursor moves off it and replace it with the correct caracter.
	replace autosapwning zeroes with a loop that checks the charachter position lists (L7{X},L8{Y},L9{Pre-Established Charachter Value})
	Edit thoughts:2 values can be stored per list entry. Ex: L1(x) returns Y. 2 variables, 1 entry. Might still not be useful because there can only be one variable per each value of X per list, because the X variable identifies the position on the list.
	probably stick with one variable in one list per each position value, that enables having multiple of each X value and Y value.
