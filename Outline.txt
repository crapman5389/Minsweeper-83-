My Minsweeper adaptation for the Ti-83 will be text based, and will play on a 7x16 grid. The top line will be reserved for score?
(The top line will be reserved for something)

Basic Components:
-Image for splashscreen ('cuz why the fuck not?) EDIT: no .83i - too advanced - Replace with output finction text
-Bomb position randomizer (pre determone bomb locations and store in variables)
-Cursor component (Use arrow keys to move a charachtor to represent the cursor. Will be displayed with output function and variables.)
-Bomb counter for opened spaces (use variables and math to determine)
-Game loss animation (replace all bombs uncovered+not with a new charahter to represent exploded bomb)
-Bomb flagging system (replace blank square with charachter to represnt flag when user selects it for bomb
-Game loss screen (either .83i or use of output function) EDIT: no .83i - too advanced

Bomb (Exploding)- Asterisk*
Flag- Exclamtion!
Uncharted- 0
Cursor- X




Thoughts:
Plan for bomb position determination- 2 Lists of random numbers in a certain range. use nested loop with random number functions to determine coordinates.
Cursor spawn + movement - Maybie use a getkey loop for (arrow keys) inside a getkey loop for (enter) // to enable movement until a position/tile is selected.
